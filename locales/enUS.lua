Intent on settling the arid region of Durotar, Thrall's new Horde expanded its ranks, inviting the undead Forsaken to join orcs, tauren, & trolls. Meanwhile, dwarves, gnomes & the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to a reinvigorated Alliance, guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind. After Stormwind's king, Varian Wrynn, mysteriously disappeared, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent but his service was marred by the manipulations & mind control of the Onyxia, who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman. As heroes investigated Onyxia's manipulations, ancient foes surfaced in lands throughout the world to menace Horde & Alliance alike.";
	["TBC_TIER_DESC"] = "The Burning Crusade is the first expansion. Its main features include an increase of the level cap up to 70, the introduction of the blood elves & the draenei as playable races, & the addition of the world of Outland, along with many new zones, dungeons, items, quests, & monsters.";
	["WOTLK_TIER_DESC"] = "Wrath of the Lich King is the second expansion. The majority of the expansion content takes place in Northrend & centers around the plans of the Lich King. Content highlights include the increase of the level cap from 70 to 80, the introduction of the death knight Hero class, & new PvP/World PvP content.";

Set primarily in a dramatically reforged Kalimdor & Eastern Kingdoms on the world of Azeroth, the expansion follows the return of Deathwing, who causes a new Sundering as he makes his cataclysmic re-entrance into the world from Deepholm. Cataclysm returns players to the two continents of Azeroth for most of their campaigning, opening new zones such as Mount Hyjal, the sunken world of Vashj'ir, Deepholm, Uldum and the Twilight Highlands. It includes two new playable races, the worgen & the goblins. The expansion increases level cap to 85, adds the ability to fly in Kalimdor & Eastern Kingdoms, introduces Archaeology & reforging, & restructures the world itself.";
	["MOP_TIER_DESC"] = "Mists of Pandaria is the fourth expansion pack. The expansion refocuses primarily on the war between the Alliance & Horde, in the wake of the accidental rediscovery of Pandaria. Adventurers rediscover the ancient pandaren people, whose wisdom will help guide them to new destinies; the Pandaren Empire's ancient enemy, the mantid; and their legendary oppressors, the enigmatic mogu. The land changes over time & the conflict between Varian Wrynn & Garrosh Hellscream escalates. As civil war wracks the Horde, the Alliance & forces in the Horde opposed to Hellscream's violent uprising join forces to take the battle directly to Hellscream & his Sha-touched allies in Orgrimmar.";

Across Draenor's savage jungles & battle-scarred plains, Azeroth's heroes will engage in a mythic conflict involving mystical draenei champions & mighty orc clans, & cross axes with the likes of Grommash Hellscream, Blackhand, & Ner’zhul at the height of their primal power. Players will need to scour this unwelcoming land in search of allies to help build a desperate defense against the old Horde’s formidable engine of conquest, or else watch their own world’s bloody, war-torn history repeat itself.";

After the defeat at the Broken Shore, the defenders of Azeroth search for the Pillars of Creation, which were Azeroth's only hope for closing the massive demonic portal at the heart of the Tomb. However, the Broken Isles came with their own perils to overcome, from Xavius, to God-King Skovald, to the nightborne, & to Tidemistress Athissa. Khadgar moved Dalaran to the shores of this land, the city serves as a central hub for the heroes. The death knights of Acherus also took their floating necropolis to the Isles. The heroes of Azeroth sought out legendary artifact weapons to wield in battle, but also found unexpected allies in the form of the Illidari. Ongoing conflict between the Alliance & the Horde led to the formation of the class orders, with exceptional commanders putting aside faction to lead their classes in the fight against the Legion.";

Azeroth paid a terrible price to end the apocalyptic march of the Legion's crusade—but even as the world's wounds are tended, it is the shattered trust between the Alliance and Horde that may prove the hardest to mend. In Battle for Azeroth, the fall of the Burning Legion sets off a series of disastrous incidents that reignites the conflict at the heart of the Warcraft saga. As a new age of warfare begins, Azeroth's heroes must set out on a journey to recruit new allies, race to claim the world's mightiest resources, and fight on several fronts to determine whether the Horde or Alliance will lead Azeroth into its uncertain future.";
