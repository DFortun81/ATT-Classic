It is located in the northwestern part of Elwynn Forest.\n\nDuring the First War, the Kingdom of Azeroth, including its capital, Stormwind Keep, was utterly destroyed by the Horde and its survivors fled to Lordaeron. After the orcs were defeated at the Dark Portal at the end of the Second War, it was decided that the city would be rebuilt. The nobles of Stormwind assembled a team of the most skilled and ingenious stonemasons and architects they could find--which later turned sour and led to the rise of the Defias.\n\nWith the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world. It serves in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the Alliance, even with remote access to the sea. It is home to the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only wizarding school in Eastern Kingdoms, as well as SI:7, a rogue intelligence organization."},{n(-17,{q(333,{races=a1}),q(334,{races=a1,sourceQuests={333},qgs={1428}}),q(353,{races=a1,sourceQuests={1097},qgs={1416}}),q(332,{races=a1,sourceQuests={61}}),q(6184,{races=a1,lvl=56,qgs={332}}),q(6183,{races=a1,lvl=56,qgs={332}}),q(1448,{maps={1435},races=a1,coords={{70,55,1435}},lvl=38,qgs={5384}}),q(6187,g({races=a1,lvl=56,qgs={1748}},{i(16996),i(16997),i(16998)})),q(6403,{races=a1,lvl=50,qgs={12580}}),q(6501,{races=a1,lvl=50,qgs={1748}}),q(6182,{races=a1,lvl=56,qgs={1748}}),q(1449,{races=a1,lvl=38,qgs={5384}})})})),m(1458,g({isRaid=1,lvl=1,description="|cff66ccff |r"},{n(-17,{q(4294,g({races=a2,lvl=48},{i(12235)})),q(7817,{races=a2,cost={

Travelers are advised to go through the pass fast, as they might fall to the zone's foreboding magic.\n\nAlthough Deadwind Pass has no quests, the mobs there are tuned to level 50-60 players.\n\nTrivia:\nMedivh, the last Guardian, made Deadwind Pass his final place. The tower of Karazhan to the south served as his bastion until his final days.\n\nAlthough Karazhan is sealed off to players, the Karazhan Crypts can be explored by players who kill themselves and traverse the gates as a ghost. The crypt is filled to the brim with disturbing content, the most disturbing being a pool filled with human bodies hanged upside down and roped to chains. This area became known to players as the Upside-Down Sinners."}),m(499,g({description="The Deeprun Tram is a long, fully enclosed, underground (and partially underwater) set of double tracks upon which rolls two sets of three wagons, all credited to the gnomes' technical engineering.
