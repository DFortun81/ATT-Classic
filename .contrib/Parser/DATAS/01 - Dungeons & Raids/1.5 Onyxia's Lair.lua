To this end it is believed that she takes on various humanoid forms and uses her charm and power to influence delicate matters between the different races. Some believe that Onyxia has even assumed an alias once used by her father - the title of the royal House Prestor. When not meddling in mortal concerns, Onyxia resides in a fiery cave below the Dragonmurk, a dismal swamp located within Dustwallow Marsh. There she is guarded by her kin, the remaining members of the insidious black dragonflight.",

It's also likely that the fear will send you into the homing beetles\n* Seemingly unlimited mana bar, so Viper Sting is useless\n* Scorpid sting has very little/no effect on him\n* Melees extremely hard and fast (200+) when in normal form\n\nWeaknesses:\n* If you use Rank 3 Wing Clip on him, it immobilizes him completely with \"Crippling Clip\" for 30 seconds.\n* The homing missiles (creepings) are not fired when you remain in melee range\n* He does NOT cast his fear when you remain in melee range\n* Must be 'chilled' via Frost Trap prior to fully engaging\n\nLocated in Silithus.",
