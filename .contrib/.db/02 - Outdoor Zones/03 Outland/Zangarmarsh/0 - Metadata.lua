The Cenarion Circle is investigating why wildlife has been dying, discovering that Lady Vashj is draining Coilfang Reservoir for her nefarious purposes. Players can also gain reputation with Sporeggar, a group of sporelings at war with ogres. Alliance players also further learn about lost ones--Draenei heavily corrupted by shadow magic--and begin gaining reputation with the Kurenai.",
