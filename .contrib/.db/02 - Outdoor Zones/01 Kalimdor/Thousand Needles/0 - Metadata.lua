Engineers have constructed bridges across the peaks of these towers, allowing travelers to cross the region without having to set foot on the ground below. The Thousand Needles is a dry and hot desert of salt. At its center is a stagnant lake ten times saltier than the ocean.\n\nResourceful goblins have discovered oil in the Scorched Basin, but they, a few scorpions, and the occasional centaur warband are the only signs of life in this parched land.",
