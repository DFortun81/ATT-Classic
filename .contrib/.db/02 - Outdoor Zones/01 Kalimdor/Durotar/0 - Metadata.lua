Warchief Thrall named the new nation after his father, Durotan, and rules ably. Horde settlements are scattered throughout the rocky land, which is only marginally more fertile than the Barrens.\n\nThe Horde’s greatest city is Orgrimmar, a warrior city that symbolizes the greatness of the orcs and their allies. Much of Durotar remains wild, and the orcs continually fend off centaur and quilboar as they attempt to tame the land.",
