			["description"] = "Once a wooded paradise, Felwood bears a ten-thousand-year-old curse. The trees, land and creatures are twisted and evil, violent and wild. Cursed ancients and furbolg maul any who come close, and satyrs hold depraved court near tainted moonwells. The animals within are mad and brutal and have no fear of humanoids. The undead and demons that survived the Third War fl ed here as well, and hide in the deep tangles. Felwood is a chaos of battling creatures, and blood soaks the ground. The infamous Shadow Council, a group of orc warlocks loyal to the Burning Legion, hides somewhere within.\n\nAlliance heroes, particularly druids, make forays into the cursed wood in attempts to destroy some of the larger menaces, root out the Shadow Council, and perhaps, some day, restore the land to its former legacy.",
