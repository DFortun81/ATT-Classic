Despite its inhospitable nature, numerous trade routes, including the major Gold Road, cross the Barrens. Centaur raiding parties are a constant threat, as are lions and thunder lizards. The orcs and tauren drove the quilboar tribes out of their lands, and the creatures now lair in the Barrens.\n\nIronforge dwarves have discovered a great Titan ruin in this region, and an enormous dig site and settlement has sprung up around it. Called Bael Modan, this fortified city is a common stop for the caravans that trundle across the dusty landscape. The goblin city of Ratchet, full of clanging coins, shining lights and debauchery, sprawls on the Barrensâ€™ eastern coast.",
