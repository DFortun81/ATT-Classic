Here, the Circle of the Ancients and the wise druids pooled their power to create a great tree akin to the World Tree, but on a smaller scale.\n\nThey called this tree Teldrassil, meaning “Crown of the Earth,” and built their city of Darnassus atop it. The island takes the name of the tree as well, and a twilit forest now covers it.",
