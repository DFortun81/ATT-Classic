			["description"] = "The Badlands is a region in Khaz Modan accessed via the Searing Gorge to the west and Loch Modan to the north.\n\nThe Badlands are a cracked desert of dry earth, scattered boulders, and winding canyons. Dark Iron dwarves clash with ogres and drakes, while Horde orcs man a fortress to keep watch on their renegade brethren in the eastern lands. Ironforge prospectors search this desolate land for Titan artifacts, inspired by the recently unearthed Uldaman — an immense ruin that held the first clues to the dwarves’ lofty origins. Stonevault troggs, released after millennia of slumber, slaughtered the explorers and viciously defend their stolen city.\n\nOnly the hardiest of creatures can survive in the arid wastes, such as feral coyotes, cougars and buzzards. In the far east is a region inhabited by black dragon spawn. Scattered across the Badlands are camps of ogres of the Dustbelcher tribe. In the northwest is a tiny Horde outpost. The northern reaches of this rugged land are home to ruins that were the workings of the ancient race, the earthen. These ruins are known as Uldaman. Dark Iron dwarves also have a large fortress just south of Uldaman.",
