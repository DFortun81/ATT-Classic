This zone is deceptively small and appears empty when first entered - however, it is without doubt, among the most dangerous places in Azeroth. It was hotly contested between the forces of Ragnaros and his Dark Iron servants on one side and the black dragon Nefarian and his orc minions on the other. This is one of the most important areas in World of Warcraft lore.",
